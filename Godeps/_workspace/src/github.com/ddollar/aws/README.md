# aws.go - A simple AWS client for Go.

# Install

	$ go get github.com/bmizerany/aws.go

## Use

	// NOTE: This project is still a work in progress.  For those of you who
	// see where I'm going with it and want to help, please do!

	package main

	import (
		"github.com/bmizerany/aws"
		"log"
	)

	// Assumes AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY are set in ENV.
	func main() {
		v, err := aws.DescribeInstances()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatal(err)
		}

		for _, r := range v.Reservations {
			for _, i := range r.Instances {
				log.Println("%s -> %s", i.DnsName, i.StateName)
			}
		}

		////
		// Custom (i.e. No sugar yet)

		r := aws.TemplateRequest // Make a copy of the template request

		// Set the Action parameter
		r.Add("Action", "DescribeKeyPairs")

		// Describe the response you expect using
		// http://weekly.golang.org/pkg/encoding/xml/#Unmarshal as a guide
		type DescribeKeyPairsResponse struct {
			aws.Header       // Holds the RequestId
			Keys       []Key `xml:"keySet>item"`
		}

		type Key struct {
			KeyName        string
			KeyFingerprint string
		}

		v := new(DescribeKeyPairsResponse)
		aws.Do(r, v)

		log.Printf("%v", v)
	}

## Change API/Creds

You can change the API and Credentials, used by the Sugar commands, by updating `aws.TemplateRequest`.

## Running tests

NOTE: Most Unix/Linux systems will not log commands to history if they start with spaces; BEWARE if yours does not.

	$ cd /path/to/repo
	$ git config add aws.key <aws-key>
	$ git config add aws.secret <aws-secret>
	$ ./development.sh gotest // Does NOT create resources

or

	$ <space><space> AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret> AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<key> gotest
